# 🔧 Backend Issues Fixed

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Authentication Token Issue**
**Problem:** Frontend wasn't sending JWT tokens to `/transcribe` endpoint
**Fix:** 
- Added `accessToken` computed property to `AuthManager.swift`
- Updated `APIClient.swift` to require auth token for `/transcribe`

**Files changed:**
- `frontend/RepoWhisper/AuthManager.swift`
- `frontend/RepoWhisper/APIClient.swift`

---

### 2. **Python 3.14 Compatibility Issue**
**Problem:** You have Python 3.14 which is very new. Some packages don't support it yet:
- `faster-whisper` requires `onnxruntime` which doesn't have Python 3.14 wheels yet
- `pillow==10.2.0` doesn't support Python 3.14

**Temporary Workaround:**
- Updated `pillow` to `>=11.0.0` (supports Python 3.14)
- Transcription is **optional** - backend works without it
- Backend shows: "⚠️  faster-whisper not installed"

**Your backend is running fine at:** http://127.0.0.1:8000

---

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Working:
- Backend is running on port 8000
- Health check: http://127.0.0.1:8000/health ✅
- API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs ✅
- Authentication: ✅
- Search endpoint: `/search` ✅
- Index endpoint: `/index` ✅
- Boss Mode `/advise` endpoint: ✅

### ⚠️ Not Working:
- Transcription `/transcribe` endpoint (requires `faster-whisper`)

---

## 🔮 Solutions

### Option 1: Use Python 3.12 (Recommended)
Install Python 3.12 and create a venv with it:

```bash
cd /Users/rahulbainsla/Desktop/RepoWhisper

# Install Python 3.12
brew install python@3.12

# Create venv with Python 3.12
/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.12/bin/python3.12 -m venv venv

# Activate and install
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** You no longer need to start the backend manually.
> The macOS app spawns the backend as a subprocess on launch
> (see `BackendProcessManager.swift`). For a built `.app`, the backend
> is a frozen binary at `Resources/repowhisper-backend-arm64`. For dev mode,
> it falls back to running `backend/main.py` from your active venv.

### Option 2: Wait for Package Updates
`onnxruntime` will eventually release Python 3.14 wheels. Check:
https://pypi.org/project/onnxruntime/#files

### Option 3: Use Without Transcription
The backend works without transcription. You can:
- Manually type search queries
- Use the repository manager
- Test all other features

Later, when `faster-whisper` supports Python 3.14, just:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install faster-whisper
```

## 🧪 Test the Frontend

### 1. Rebuild Frontend:
```bash
cd /Users/rahulbainsla/Desktop/RepoWhisper/frontend
xcodegen generate
open RepoWhisper.xcodeproj
# Press ⌘B to build
# Press ⌘R to run
```

### 2. Test Features:
1. ✅ **Login** - Should work now (you're already logged in!)
2. ✅ **Repository Manager** - Click "Manage Repositories"
3. ✅ **Index a repo** - Add a folder and index it
4. ✅ **Manual search** - Type a query directly
5. ✅ **Floating popup** - Should appear with results
6. ⚠️ **Voice transcription** - Won't work until faster-whisper is installed

## 📊 Error Logs Explained

### From your terminal output:
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:50752 - "POST /transcribe HTTP/1.1" 401 Unauthorized
```

**Before Fix:** Frontend not sending JWT token
**After Fix:** Frontend now sends JWT token (but transcription still needs Python 3.12)

---

## 🎯 Quick Test Without Transcription

You can test everything else:

1. **Backend startup is automatic** — the macOS app spawns it on launch
   once at least one repo folder has been approved. No manual start needed.

2. **Test manually** (if you want to hit the API directly while the app is running):
   ```bash
   # Health check
   curl http://localhost:8000/health
   
   # Get your JWT token from frontend
   # Then test search (you'll need to index first)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/search \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
     -d '{"query": "authentication", "topK": 5}'
   ```

3. **Or use the UI**:
   - Open the app
   - Click "Manage Repositories"
   - Add a repo
   - Index it
   - Type a search query directly (no voice)
   - Watch the popup appear!

---

## 💡 Summary

**The main issues are FIXED:**
- ✅ Frontend now sends auth tokens
- ✅ Backend is running and responding
- ✅ All endpoints work (except transcription)

**One remaining issue:**
- ⚠️ Transcription needs Python 3.12 (not 3.14)

**Recommendation:**
Use Python 3.12 for full functionality, or test without transcription for now!

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the new UI** (it's beautiful!)
   - Repository Manager
   - Floating Popup
   - Modern animations

2. **Either:**
   - Switch to Python 3.12 for transcription
   - OR continue without voice features

3. **Enjoy your very green GitHub graph!** 🟢🟢🟢
